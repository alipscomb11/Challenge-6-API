# Challenge-6-API

2.	Description:  The focus of this challenge is the practical utilization of Python, Panda coding, and a Weather API key to initiate requests to a data server and have the server provide a response in the form of a JSON. In this challenge we are tasked with creating Python script to visualize weather. In addition, we will use Jupyter notebooks, GeoViews Python libraries, and a Geoapify API key analyze weather data and plan a future vacation. The final code for this challenge is located in a folder called Challenge-6-API. Some of the key areas that will be analyzed are as follows:

3.	
a.	WeatherPy Plots that showcase
    i.	   Latitude vs. Temperature
    ii.	   Latitude vs. Humidity
    iii.   Latitude vs. Cloudiness
    iv.	   Latitude vs. Wind Speed
b.	WeatherPy Linear Regression Plots:
    i.	   Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
    ii.	   Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
    iii.   Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
    iv.	   Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
    v.	   Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
    vi.	   Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
    vii.   Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
    viii.  Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
c.	VacationPy 
    i.	   City Map for ever city in the provided DataFrame
    ii.	   Max Temperature
    iii.   Wind Speed
    iv.	   Cloudiness
    v.	   Hotel City, Country, Coordinates, and Humidity
    vi.	   Hotels within the 10,000 meters
    vii.   Hotel Name and Country.
4.	Usage

a)	Inside the Challenge folder the following files are added:
   i.	  api_keys.py
   ii.	  WeatherPy.ipynb
   iii.	  VacationPy.ipynb
   iv.	  .gitignore

b)	In order to achieve the coding outputs described above, the script sequencing for the PyCitySchools requirements are as follows:
   i.	 Import pandas as pd from the pathlib import path
   ii.	 Read the pandas file
   iii.	 Perform the calculations/iterations needed to achieve the output requirement
   iv.	 Produce the final output

5.	Dependencies
a.	Importing and reading the correct pandas are critical to enable code execution. 
b.	The correct use of strings, variables, and conditions were also very important with this Challenge and the ability to obtain the correct output.

6.	Known Issues: Issues with the script.
a.	I had issues narrowing down the city_data DataFrame to find the ideal weather condition. Seems there were issues with the parameters I chose.
